This is a temporary repo. It is made specially for the Hacktober Fest 2020. I am probably going to archive it after the event.
  I really haven't contributed to open source before. There are a lot like me, so this is for them basically. You can practice by making any kind of algorithm, language, contibutions. I will accept all the legit pull requests.<br/>
  
  
  Data Structures, Algorithms and various real life Coding implementations by various open-source contributors.<br/><br/>
**Open to contributions for Hacktoberfest to get started with github, and other open source collaboration**
